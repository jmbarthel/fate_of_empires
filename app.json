    "description": "Fate of empires is a deckbuilding card game beginning at the dawn of time. Your empire starts with a single technology, city, and person from your region at its helm. Lead your empire from a disorganized anarchy to one with a centralized government, to constructing mystical ancient wonders, to the modern age. Throughout the course of the game you must make touch choices on how to transform from an ancient Empire constructing wonders to old gods through the hard work of peasants, to one that values people, technologies, and cities, leaving behind the old ways and pioneering your future into that of a world leader. What will be your empires fate?"
